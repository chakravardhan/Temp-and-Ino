# Temp-and-Ino

This project was does as part of electronics course. We used lego kit to build the car. Then we used Aurdino chip and L239d motor drivers to drive 2 DC motors attached to the rear wheels. We put a bluetooth module which connects to an Android App.The entire bot can be controlled using an Android App developed on our own.
